# Managish

[Website](https://managish.ml)

The Managish (What's Accessible) app was developed as part of a school project to use technology in order to help people with disabilities.

The problem that the app solves is finding and sharing accessible places for people with disabilities in a social network model.

In the app, you can search for businesses by service type and accessibility features.
Every user is welcome to publish a review on the businesses he visits and help the disabled community in Israel.

The project was a team effort that included researching about accessibility and the disabled community in Israel.

I came up with the initial idea for a social app, created the design and developed it as a mobile app.

I digitally designed the app's UI using Adobe XD.
I implemented the frontend as a React Native app for iOS and Android, and the backend in Node.js deployed on IBM Cloud. For securing the app and managing users I used the awesome Auth0 service. I used Backblaze B2 for object storage and IBM Cloudant as a database.
